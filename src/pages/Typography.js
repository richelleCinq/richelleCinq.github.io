        <p> In my design journey, typography seemed so foreign.
          It was not due to a lack of interest or admiration, but to a profound understanding of its nature - as simple as its anatomy and its purposes.
          After becoming more familiar with it, I find myself deeply appreciating its significance, beauty, and what it could bring to any design I do.</p >
        <p>Boop was my first project designing a font using Fontstruct, a font-building online tool using modular blocks or geometric shapes as
          part of the design constraint. While it added another layer of challenge, I was set on creating something that would be more fluid and organic.</p>
        <p>The second typeface I created was Ophelia. During the pandemic, I watched one too many Netflix movies that I couldn’t help but create a font for a
          captivating character and protagonist. After a few hand-drawn iterations, I opted for the contrast of thin and thick lines and channeled Neo-classical
          and Humanist styles - a reflection of the character’s delicate nature. Ophelia’s design is intended for display applications; however, if used in smaller
          font sizes, it hides some of the decorations on certain letters. These decorations can only be appreciated when zoomed in, which reminds me of Ophelia’s story.</p>
